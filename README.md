Thermostat Controller
=====================

I wrote this python program to run on a raspberry pi 3 B+ which acts like a
thermostat. I could have bought a Nest or Ecobee, but what’s the fun in that?
Plus it seemed simple enough for my first electrical project! I made two remote
temperature/humidity sensors that report data to the thermostat every 5
seconds. When the temperature reaches below or above the set threshold, it
truns on the correct relay to signal the furnace or air conditioner to turn on.
